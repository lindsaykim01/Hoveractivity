	Inside a crumpled, relatively thin and flimsy plastic container, is a side profile of a duck eraser that was made in Japan as both the <span class="green" href="http://www.neopets.com">green</span>-white label above it notates. It has <span class= "lightpink">light pink wings</span> that cascade down from its round, slightly textured head. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>	<span class="shape"></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	


	Its underbelly is in a nude, beige color that contrasts with its brown eye and beak. In terms of approximate size, it is unclear because of the dark, black background and no other object to compare to within its vicinity.
